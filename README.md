## About
This is a simple app that import data from https://launchlibrary.net api to
display information about:
- Name of rocket being launched (e.g. "Falcon 9")
- Space agency responsible for the launch (e.g. "NASA")
- Launch location (e.g. "Cape Canaveral")
- Time of launch
- Wikipedia links for each launch, agency and rocket

To use the app, simply clone it into your computer, then run npm install to
install all the dependencies.

## Dependencies
This app was written in Javascript with NodeJs and ExpressJs in the backend, and
ReactJs in the frontend. I used create-react-app to create install React. If you
have any troubles with it or want to know more about the library.
